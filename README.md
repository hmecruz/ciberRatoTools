# CiberRato Robot Simulation Environment <br/> Universidade de Aveiro / IEETA 

## Information

CiberRato Robot Simulation Environment simulates the movement
of robots inside a labyrinth.  Robots objective is to go from their
starting position to beacon area and then return to their start position.

The MicroRato competition
[http://microrato.ua.pt/], held annually at Aveiro University, 
uses these these tools for its Explorer league.

## Installation  

The source code was compiled with **gcc/g++ (v9.3.0)** using **Qt libraries (v5.12.8)** on **Ubuntu 20.04**.  

### 1. Install dependencies  

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake qtmultimedia5-dev
```

### 2. Build the simulation environment

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### Start the Challenge-Specific Viewer
```bash
./startC1
./startC2
./startC3
./startC4
```

## Running the Developed Agent
My developed agent can be found in the agent/ folder. It was used in four challenges of the MicroRato competition, where I achieved:

- **Challenge 1** ‚Äì ü•à 2nd place  
- **Challenge 2** ‚Äì ü•á 1st place  
- **Challenge 3** ‚Äì ü•à 2nd place  
- **Challenge 4** ‚Äì ü•à 2nd place

### Setup
#### 1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux / macOS
venv\\Scripts\\activate      # Windows
```

#### 2. Install Python requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Run a Challenge:
Navigate to the corresponding challenge directory (C1, C2, C3, or C4) and run:
```bash
python main.py
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Important: You must be inside the specific challenge directory to start it. The challenges can be found at agent/C#/.


## Challenges

### Challenge 1 ‚Äì Control
**Objective:** Control the robot‚Äôs movement through an unknown closed circuit as fast as possible, avoiding wall collisions.

### Challenge 2 ‚Äì Mapping
**Objective:** Explore an unknown maze and extract its map.

### Challenge 3 ‚Äì Planning
**Objective:** Explore an unknown maze, locate multiple target spots, and compute the shortest closed path visiting all spots, starting and ending at the starting position.

### Challenge 4 ‚Äì Localization, Mapping & Planning

#### Localization
- Navigate and localize the robot in an unknown maze using only noisy sensors (motors, compass, obstacle, beacon).  
- No GPS available; collisions are penalized.

#### Mapping
- Explore the maze, extract the map, and identify all target spots.  
- The agent must return to the starting spot after mapping.

#### Planning
- Compute a minimal-cost closed path visiting all target spots, starting and ending at the starting position.  
- Noise parameters are specified in `C4-config.xml`.
